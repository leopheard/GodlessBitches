It is a media production of the Atheist Community of Austin and features regular contributions from Jen Peeples, Tracie Harris, Clare Wuellner and others.<br>
Godless Bitches streams live on Youtube every first Saturday of the month at 11am CDT. Past episodes are downloadable from our archive. If you're enjoying the program, help get the word out to others that they can listen live or via podcast.<br>
